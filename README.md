# Python Kata

I want to get jobs that have python in their stack. Python is dope because it's basically the nodejs of ai and data science.

I asked ChatGPT to challenge me with Python challenges. For each challenge, hand-wrote a solution, using google to check on python syntax and common utilities.

I hope to use these katas to help me get a job where I can play with data, do more AI stuff, computer vision, LLMs, etc.
